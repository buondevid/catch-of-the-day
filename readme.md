# First React Project - Fish Market's Menu and Inventory

I created a simple React app to get used and learn React fundamentals:_Props_, _State_, _Components_, _Create React App_, _JSX_, _TypeProps_, _Events handling_, _Lifecycle_ are some of the concepts I've became accustomed to.

I also developed Auth methods (Facebook, Github, Twitter) and made use of Firebase and localStorage: to try out those features, just log in a couple of times in a row with the same method (Firebase rules are _open_, so everybody can edit and see the sample inventory).

It has been developed mainly without using Hooks, mostly I've used class components to learn the basics.
